# odin-recipes

This is a project I did for The Odin Project.

- I took what I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  over the years and made it not so basic.

- For example, I used an iframe to load pages into
  instead of navigating from page to page as usual.

- Using JavaScript, I made the page fully responsive
  across different devices to dynamically resize the
  heights of the nav menu and the iframe element itself.
  I used `onload` and `onchange` on the body tag. I did
  this to avoid having the nav menu from overlaying the
  iframe element on some devices. Also, I wanted some
  consistency on how the page appears across devices.
  Hard-coding the height values in the CSS would've
  prevented that consistency.

- I applied `overflow-x: hidden;` on the body element
  to avoid side-scrolling on some devices.

- I tested all the different devices available in Google
  Chrome inspector.

- I used the Google search engine to figure out how to
  accompanied what I did on this project, especially
  when I was manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript
  and dynamically applying them to CSS property values.

- I used GIMP to convert webp files to jpg files, so
  I created a .gitignore file to prevent committing webp
  and GIMP xcf source files to this repository.

the recipes, just in case someone wants to try one or
more of them out.
