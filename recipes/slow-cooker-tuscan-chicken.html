      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        When it's too hot to cook, throw this dinner in the slow cooker and wait
        for compliments. This rustic dish uses boneless, skinless chicken
        thighs, lots of seasonings, and pitted Castelvetrano olives. We really
        enjoy their brighter taste and color in this dish. The red pepper flakes
        just add a bit of zing to the sun dried tomatoes and good-for-you
        spinach in the sauce. Be sure to serve this with a crusty bread, so you
        can soak up all the tasty, creamy goodness!
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2.2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup pitted and halved Castelvetrano olives</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced onion</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups torn fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Spray the interior of the slow cooker with cooking spray, or use a
          plastic liner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place chicken thighs in the bottom of the slow cooker and sprinkle
          with Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evenly layer sun-dried tomatoes and sliced olives over the seasoned
          chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion to the hot
          oil and cook until onions begin to get tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add
          garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a slotted spoon, transfer onions to the slow cooker and spread
          evenly over the sun-dried tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the skillet to medium heat and add cream, stirring until all
          the olive oil is incorporated and the sauce begins to bubble. Pour
          cream sauce evenly over the onions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover slow cooker and cook on High for 3 to 4 hours or Low for 6 to 7
          hours if you prefer a longer cook time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove cooked chicken and vegetables to a serving platter. Add torn
          spinach to the sauce and cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove
          spinach from sauce with a slotted spoon and place on top of the
          chicken and vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sauce will be a bit thin. If you like a thicker sauce, pour into a
          small saucepan over medium heat. Combine 2 tablespoons cornstarch and
          2 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Stir until all the lumps are
          gone, to create a slurry. Add slurry to the sauce and cook over
          medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until bubbly and thickened, 5
          to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon sauce and spinach over the dish and serve warm.</li>
